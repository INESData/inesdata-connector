## About this Extension

This extension adds a policy function that allows validating the consuming EDC Connector's DAT claim
value `referringConnector`. This allows to limit data-offer access to specific consumers.

Adds permission function with left side expression `REFERRING_CONNECTOR` with the currently supported
`EQ` operator.

## Why does this extension exist?

Especially in data spaces where data is shared with business partners for specific purposes, data assets need to
be offered to desired consumers only.
